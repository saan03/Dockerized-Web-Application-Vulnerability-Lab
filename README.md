Dockerized Web Application Vulnerability Lab

Project Overview
This project involves developing a web application with intentional vulnerabilities, packaged within a Docker container. The objective is to create a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges where participants can exploit these vulnerabilities to find hidden flags.

Key Components
Docker Setup: The application will run in an isolated, secure Docker container.
Web Application: A multi-page application with vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, and Insecure File Upload.
Vulnerabilities and Flags: Deliberate vulnerabilities will be introduced, with hidden flags embedded within the application.
Documentation: Comprehensive setup and run instructions, challenge descriptions, and hints.

Initial Commit
This initial commit marks the start of the project. The repository will be regularly updated with the development progress.
